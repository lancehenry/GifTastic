## Description
The user can enter any cast member from Saturday Night Live and it will dynamically create a new button below. When the user clicks on a button that will trigger a function to load 10 gifs of that cast member using the Giphy API. This web application uses very minimal HTML and dynamically updates the page.

## How it was built
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, Giphy API
