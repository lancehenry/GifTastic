# SNL GifTastic

## Description
The user can enter any cast member from Saturday Night Live and it will dynamically create a new button below. When the user clicks on a button that will trigger a function to load 10 gifs of that cast member using the Giphy API. This web application uses very minimal HTML and dynamically updates the page. The gifs load on the page paused and when the user click on each gif, they animate. When clicked again, they pause.

## How it was built
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, Giphy API
